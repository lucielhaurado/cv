Profile: Professional Translator fluent in Spanish and English, with expertise in translating to and from French. I earned a Master's degree in Translation and Intercultural Mediation from the University of Salamanca in Spain ans a Master's degree in Institutional Translation from the University of Alicante. I am perfectly bilingual and well-versed in addressing intercultural challenges. This enhances my ability to provide culturally sensitive and accurate translations, bridging linguistic gaps seamlessly.
